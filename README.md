# Simple-Label-Encoder-in-Python
This project provides a lightweight, type-safe Encoder class written in Python for mapping labels (e.g., class names, tags, tokens) to numerical indices and decoding them back. Itâ€™s useful in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data preprocessing tasks where categorical data needs to be converted into numeric format.
