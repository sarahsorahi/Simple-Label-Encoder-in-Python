# Simple-Label-Encoder-in-Python
This project provides a lightweight, type-safe Encoder class written in Python for mapping labels (e.g., class names, tags, tokens) to numerical indices and decoding them back. It’s useful in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data preprocessing tasks where categorical data needs to be converted into numeric format.


# Goal

Provide a clean and easy-to-use Encoder class that supports:

Bi-directional mapping between labels and indices

Type safety using Python generics

Safe handling of unknown classes

Example-based testing with doctest
